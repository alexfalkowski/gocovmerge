# Gazelle configuration for this repository.
#
# Gazelle will use BUILD.bazel as the build file name and this module path as
# the Go import prefix.
# NOTE: Bazel/Gazelle also accept these via the gazelle rule args, but having a
# .gazelle file makes the config apply consistently (including when running
# Gazelle directly).

build_file_name BUILD.bazel
go_prefix github.com/alexfalkowski/gocovmerge/v2

# This repo vendors deps for Go tooling, but Bazel resolves deps independently.
# We keep vendored code out of Gazelle's package generation.
exclude vendor

# Some repositories include generated outputs; keep common ones out of scanning.
exclude dist

# `bin/` is a git submodule with build/CI tooling; it is not part of the Go
# module packages we build with Bazel, and it contains files named `BUILD` that
# are not Bazel BUILD files. Excluding it prevents Gazelle/Bazel from scanning
# and treating those as packages.
exclude bin
